# Vector-without-STL
Self made vector in C++

Formulation of the problem:
Develop a program - a console application for Windows, which demonstrates the capabilities of the C ++ language, as well as its standard library for working with threads, containers and iterators.
The use of all the above features is mandatory in each of the options for individual tasks. In each of the following task options you must implement the basic features of the library of standard templates: iterator (s), search, ordering, sum or something similar with the consent of the teacher. programs should take into account the need to ensure its assembly in two modes:
1.Creation of an executable file with connection / use of types and algorithms of library of standard templates (STL).
2. Create an executable file without using STL.
